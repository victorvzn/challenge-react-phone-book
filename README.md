# Challenge: React Phone Book

**Source:** Coderbyte

We provided some simple React template code. Your goal is to create a simple form at the top that allows the user to enter in a first name, last name, and phone numer and there should be a submit button. Once the submit button is pressed, the information should be displayed in a list below (automatically sorted by last name) along with all the previous information that was entered. This way the application can function as a simple phone book. When your application loads, the input fields (not the phone book list) should be prepopulated with following values already:

```
First name = Coder
Last name = Byte
Phone = 8885559999
```

You are free to add classes and styles, but make sure you leave the element ID's as they are. Submit your code once it is cokplete and our system will validate your output.
